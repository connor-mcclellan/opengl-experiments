# cube

A minimal implementation of a 3D orthographic camera rotating around an unlit cube. Shaders and source code are all contained within the same `main.cpp` script for simplicity. Necessary checks like ensuring the shaders and source code compile and link properly are omitted to keep the source code short, but these should be added back in for continuing development.

Compile and run with

```
g++ main.cpp -lGLEW -lglfw -lGL
./a.out
```
